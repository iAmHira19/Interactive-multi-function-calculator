# Interactive Multi-Function Calculator

This Python project provides an interactive multi-function calculator that performs a variety of mathematical operations. The calculator allows users to solve proportions, solve linear equations, factor square roots, and convert between decimals, fractions, and percents. 

## Features

- **Solve Proportions**: Solves proportions of the form `a/b = c/x`.
- **Solve Linear Equations**: Solves linear equations of the form `ax + b = c`.
- **Factor Square Roots**: Factors the square root of a given number into its prime factors.
- **Convert Decimals**: Converts decimals to fractions and percents.
- **Convert Fractions**: Converts fractions to decimals and percents.
- **Convert Percents**: Converts percents to decimals and fractions.

## Installation

To use this calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can run the code directly in a Python environment or in Google Colaboratory.

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interactive-multi-function-calculator.git
